# -Video-to-Training-Module-Q-A-Generator-
I’ve developed a small tool that lets you train your bot locally without sharing your video data with any external LLM. You can use this tool by feeding it your own video — it will process the content and generate questions and answers based on that data. You can then use this output to train your local LLM or internal chatbot securely.
